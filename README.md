# Learning Tesseract with Anime Data

Welcome to the Anime Data Extraction Learning Repository! This project serves as a learning exercise to understand how to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Tesseract OCR engine in Python. While not a full-fledged program, it provides a step-by-step guide for beginners to practice text extraction from anime images.

## Overview

In this learning experience, we explore the process of using Tesseract, a powerful OCR tool, to extract text from anime images. We focus on extracting specific data such as the year, episodes, title, rating, and genres from anime images. This repository is designed for beginners who want to gain hands-on experience with image processing and text extraction using Tesseract.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Tesseract**: Tesseract is the OCR engine used for text recognition. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system: [Install Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BMugo84/python-ocr.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the ipynb file:
   ```
   cd image2text.ipynb
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have Tesseract installed as per the provided link.

5. Place your anime images in the `anime_alpha_photos/photos` directory.

6. Review the step-by-step guide in the Jupyter Notebook to understand how Tesseract is used for text extraction.
